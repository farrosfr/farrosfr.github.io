If you’ve forgotten the Wi-Fi password that was previously used on your Windows device, you can easily recover it using Command Prompt. Here’s how you can do it:

## 1. Open Command Prompt

* Press the **Windows** key, type “Command Prompt” or “CMD” in the search bar.
* Right-click on “Command Prompt” and select “Run as Administrator” to open it with administrator rights.

## 2. Display Saved Wi-Fi Network Profiles

* In the Command Prompt window, type the following command and press **Enter**:

netsh wlan show profiles

* This command will list all the Wi-Fi networks that your computer has previously connected to.

netsh wlan show profiles

## 3. View the Password for a Specific Network

* To view the password for a specific network, type the following command, replacing `Wi-FiName` with the actual name of your network, and press **Enter**:

netsh wlan show profile name="Wi-FiName" key=clear

* Example: If your network name is “Home123,” the command would be:

netsh wlan show profile name="Home123" key=clear

* The information for that network will be displayed. Scroll down to the “Security settings” section and look for “Key Content.” The Wi-Fi password will be shown here.

From the picture above, we can see that the Wi-Fi network ‘Anti Riba’ has the password ‘antiriba’.

## Important Notes

* Make sure you have administrator privileges when running these commands.
* This method only works for Wi-Fi networks you’ve previously connected to and stored on your computer.

By following these steps, you can easily find your forgotten Wi-Fi password without needing to reset your router or search for old notes.
