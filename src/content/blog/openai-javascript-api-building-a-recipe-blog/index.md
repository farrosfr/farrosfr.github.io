In this project, we’ll build a recipe generator that provides tailored recipe recommendations by providing the model with context about our dietary preferences, ingredients on hand, and cuisine favorites. We’ll practice prompt engineering to format the model output recipes in the best format for our blog.

Let’s get cooking!

Start the project by importing the `OpenAI` class from the `openai` library.

import OpenAI from "openai";

Create a string variable named apiToken to store your OpenAI API key. Make sure this token is kept secure and never published to the public. To access the token you can create it on the following OpenAI page: [https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile?tab=api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/settings/profile?tab=api-keys)

const apiToken = 'your-openai-api-key';

Initializing the OpenAI Client with the API Token: When creating an instance of the OpenAI class, pass the API token as an option to authenticate your requests.

const client = new OpenAI({  
    apiKey: apiToken  
});

Create an `userProfile` object, you can update the dietary restrictions, cuisine preferences, and ingredients to reflect Indonesian cuisine. Here is an example:

const userProfile = {  
  dietaryRestrictions: 'halal',  
  cuisinePreferences: 'Indonesian, Sundanese, Javanese',  
  ingredientsAvailable: 'tempeh, tofu, coconut milk, chili, lemongrass'  
};

This object includes:

* `dietaryRestrictions` set to `'halal'`
* `cuisinePreferences` set to `'Indonesian, Sundanese, Javanese'`
* `ingredientsAvailable` set to `'tempeh, tofu, coconut milk, chili, lemongrass'`

Create an object called `systemPrompt` with the specified instructions for the AI, use the following syntax:

const systemPrompt = {
  role: 'system',
  content: 'Generate an HTML code for a recipe blog that considers dietary restrictions, cuisine type, and ingredients.'  
};

Create a string variable named `**userContent1**` that begins the user prompt. This string should start with a sentence indicating your intention to create a recipe blog post. Then, proceed to include the relevant data from the `**userProfile**` object, making sure to specify what each piece of data from `**userProfile**` represents.

const userContent1 = `I want to create a recipe blog post. Here are my dietary restrictions: ${userProfile.dietaryRestrictions}. My cuisine preferences include: ${userProfile.cuisinePreferences}. The ingredients I have available are: ${userProfile.ingredientsAvailable}.`;

Construct a string called `userContent2` that outlines the structure of a blog post, use the following syntax:

const userContent2 = `Please provide a blog post with a title, description, ingredients, and instructions. Format the ingredients and instructions as follows: Ingredients should be bulleted, and instructions should be numbered.`;

Construct a string named `userContent3` that establishes certain limitations for the recipe creation, use the following syntax:

const userContent3 = `The recipe must use only the listed ingredients and should result in a single blog post with instructions not exceeding six steps.`;

Define an object named `userPrompt` that holds the instructions for the AI, use the following syntax:

const userPrompt = {  
  role: 'user',  
  content: `${userContent1}n${userContent2}n${userContent3}`  
};

This object includes the `role` key with the value `"user"` and the `content` key with the concatenated strings `userContent1`, `userContent2`, and `userContent3`, separated by newline characters for readability.

To initiate a chat completion using the `client` variable, follow these steps:

1. Use the `client.chat.completions.create` method.
2. Pass the `model` argument with the value `"gpt-4o-mini"` or `"gpt-4o"`.
3. Pass the `messages` argument with an array containing `systemPrompt` and `userPrompt`.
4. Assign the return value to a variable called `response`.

Here’s the code:

const response = await client.chat.completions.create({  
  model: "gpt-4o",  
  messages: [systemPrompt, userPrompt]  
});

To output the chat completion reply content to the terminal, use the following syntax:

console.log(response.choices[0].message.content);

This will print the content of the AI’s reply to the terminal. Make sure to place this line after the `response` variable has been assigned.

The result of this process should be HTML code that is prepared for review and can then be published on the website. Here is an example of the response result:

This tutorial showcases how to leverage the OpenAI JavaScript API to create a tailored recipe blog generator. By integrating dietary preferences, available ingredients, and specific cuisine choices into the model’s prompts, you can generate customized, blog-ready recipes with minimal effort. Through this project, we’ve demonstrated the power of prompt engineering and API interaction to build dynamic content that meets users’ needs, offering a scalable solution for personalized recipe creation on your blog.
